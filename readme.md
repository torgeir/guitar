## Plans

- [x] show the notes of a guitar neck
- [x] visualize scales on the neck
- [ ] visualize different positions of scales on the neck
- [ ] support a variety of scales
- [ ] show what notes selected scales have in common
- [ ] visualize root, thirds, fifths, sevents, ninths, thirteens in each position of each scale
- [ ] an easy to use drum machine with support for more interesting measures than 4/4

## Setup

`clojure -A:clj-kondo/config --lib rum`

Jack in via `cider-jack-in-clj&cljs` from a cljs file or run `clojure
